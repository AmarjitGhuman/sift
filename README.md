# SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit (SIFT)

This repository is used to track all issues for SIFT.

## Important 

SIFT is moving to using `Salt` for configuration management of the SIFT VM. This is being coordinated with a similar effort for REMnux so that the two distributions will be compatible and not conflict with each other.

If you are interested in contributing or testing out this new installation method, please visit the [sift-salt](https://github.com/sans-dfir/sift-saltstack) repository.

## Legacy Install and Update Method

Currently the old method of install and update via a bash script is still available https://github.com/sans-dfir/sift-bootstrap.
