# SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit (SIFT)

This repository is used to track all issues for SIFT.

## Important

If you have not run the bootstrap script since August 15th, 2015, you will need to re-run it to update. The update script will **not** work. There was a change to how plaso is packaged and its required dependencies. `binplist` must be removed before running the update-script or re-run the bootstrap script to fix.
